      The snow leopard, or <em>Panthera uncia</em>, inhabits cold mountainous regions throughout Central 
      and South Asia. It's a member of the <em>Pantera</em> genus along with the lion, tiger, 
      leopard, and jaguar, and it's the only member of this genus that's incapable of roaring. Snow 
      leopards have physical feautures that help them to thrive in cold environments, such as broad paws 
      to more easily walk on snow and small ears to minimize loss of heat. As carnivores, snow leopards 
      often hunt relatively large prey such as sheeps and goats.
