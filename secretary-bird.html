      The secretary bird, or <em>Sagittarius serpentarius</em>, is a bird of prey found throughout a 
      variety of locations in sub-Saharan Africa. It is known for the distinct feathers around its head, 
      as well as its long legs that it uses to stomp on the prey it's hunting. Secretary birds are 
      carnivores, and they usually eat animals such as mice, animals, and snakes. Additionally, they 
      usually lay one to three eggs over a period of several days.
