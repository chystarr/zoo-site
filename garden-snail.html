      The garden snail, or <em>Cornu aspersum</em> or <em>Cryptomphalus aspersus</em>, is one of the 
      most common and widely known varieties of land snail. It originated in the Mediterranean region, 
      and its range of natural habitats include regions throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe. In addition, 
      it has been introduced to the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Garden snails primarily have 
      herbivorous diets, but they can also feed on worms and other snails. Like other snails, they move 
      through the use of a body part known as a foot, and the mucus they secrete helps them do this.
