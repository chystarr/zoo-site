      The reindeer, or <em>Rangifer tarandus</em>, is found in regions located far to the north, in North 
      America, Siberia, and Northern Europe. In North America, it is also known as the caribou. Different 
      subspecies of reindeer take both forests and tundras as their habitats. Unlike other species of 
      deer, both male and female reindeer grow antlers. Reindeer are capable of perceiving shorter 
      wavelengths of light than humans can, and as such can see in the ultraviolet range. While reindeer 
      have mainly herbivorous diets, they have been known to sometimes eat bird eggs and rodents.
